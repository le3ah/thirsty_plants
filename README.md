# README
## Description

Thirsty Plants is an 11-day, five-person project during Mod 3 of 4, for Turing School's Backend Engineering Program.

Our challenge was to create a web application from idea to inception. Project requirements include: authentication with a third-party service, consuming an api, and solving a real-world problem.

Thus, Thirsty Plants was born. Thirsty Plants is a web application designed to assist users in keep tracking of watering their gardens, in accordance with the precipitation in their local area. The application utilizes the languages of Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, the web framework of Rails, and authentication via Google OAuth. The Dark Sky weather API is utilized to consume precipitation data.
